# Running Analysis

This repository holds an analysis of my running habits and development. The goal of this project is to motivate me with numbers that interest me.

Data is collected from my Garmin watches and hence it only includes runs that I logged on those. 
Analysis focuses on runs and does not include bike rides, swims, and any brick workouts.
